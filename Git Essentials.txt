Git Commands

Setup:
1. git init
2. git remote add remoteName urlToRepo
3. git pull remoteName branchYouWantToPull
//Note that pulling a branch doesn't necessarily put you on that branch

Branching:
1. git branch
	- to check which branch you're on
2. git branch nameOfNewBranch
	- to create a new branch
3. git checkout branchName
	- to move to branchName
	
	
Steps to updating online repository with files from your local repo:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Description" -m "Other description, if you like"
3. git push origin branchname
	- If this returns an error
		- That means there are conflicts.
		- Run "git pull remoteName branchYouAreCommitingTo".
		- This will then tell you which files had conflicts (which are the files you have to fix)
		- Fix those files.
		- Start from step 1 again.

Extra:
1. git log
	- shows you the commits into the branch that you're on
2. git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
	- shows you a graph of how your branches and commits connect to each other


Important: Generally, you don't push directly into master. You push to a branch you created and then merge them.
